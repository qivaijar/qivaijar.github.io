## Introduction

Product Lifecycle Management is a strategic process used by organizations to manage a product from its inception through its development, launch, and maintenance. The goal of PLM is to maximize a productâ€™s value by coordinating people, processes, and information throughout each stage of its life. It helps streamline operations, reduce costs, and ensure that the product aligns with customer needs and business objectives.

## Stages of Product Lifecycle Management

**1. Concept and Design**: This stage is the foundation of the product's lifecycle. It begins with idea generation, market research, feasibility studies, and product or feature design.

**2. Development**: Once the concept is validated, the development phase focuses on turning the product or feature design into reality.

**3. Testing**: Before deploying the product or feature, it undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets the desired standards for performance and quality.

**4. Deployment**: Once testing is complete, the product or feature is ready to be deployed into the production environment.

**5. Maintenance**: After the product is deployed, the maintenance phase focuses on supporting the product or feature and making improvements as needed.
