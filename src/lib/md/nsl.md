## About

I worked as a full-time researcher at the Networked System Laboratory (NSL) in Kumoh National Institute of Technology (KIT) from February 2018 to January 2020. While pursuing my master's degree, I focused on researching the integration of machine learning algorithms with wireless communication systems. I presented my findings at several international conferences and published more detailed versions in international journals.
