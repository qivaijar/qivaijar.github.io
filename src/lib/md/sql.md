## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language)  is a programming language used to communicate with databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data stored in relational databases. SQL is essential for managing and manipulating structured data and is widely used in applications that need to store information like user accounts, product catalogs, or transactional records.

## Key Features

- **Data Retrieval (SELECT)**:  SQL allows you to query and retrieve data from databases using simple statements.
- **Data Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):**: You can add, modify, or remove data in tables.
- **Data Definition (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)**: SQL enables you to create and modify database structures like tables and indexes.
- **Data Control (GRANT, REVOKE)**: You can manage access rights to the data by granting or revoking user permissions.
- **Transaction Control (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)**: SQL supports ensuring data integrity by committing changes or rolling them back in case of errors.
