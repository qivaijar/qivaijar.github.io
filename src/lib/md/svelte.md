# Svelte

Svelte is a modern framework for building fast and reactive web applications. Unlike traditional frameworks, Svelte compiles your code into highly optimized JavaScript at build time, which results in a faster experience for users.

## Key Features

- **Reactivity**: Svelte makes it easy to create dynamic user interfaces by automatically updating the DOM when your data changes.
  
- **Component-Based**: Svelte allows you to build applications using reusable components, each containing its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **No Virtual DOM**: Unlike other frameworks, Svelte doesn't use a virtual DOM. Instead, it updates the DOM directly, leading to better performance.

- **Compile-Time Optimization**: Svelte compiles your code into small, efficient JavaScript files that run faster and load quicker.
