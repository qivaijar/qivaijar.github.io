## Introduction

[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google. It provides a robust infrastructure for hosting applications, storing data, and leveraging machine learning, among many other services. GCP allows businesses and developers to build, deploy, and scale applications in a highly reliable and secure environment, using the same infrastructure that powers Google's own services like Google Search, Gmail, and YouTube. It offers a variety of tools for compute, storage, networking, data analytics, and AI/ML, making it a go-to platform for organizations of all sizes.
