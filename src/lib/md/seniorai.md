## About

I was promoted to Senior Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer in July 2021. My primary responsibility is leading the Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Paralinguistic Research team. This role extends my duties beyond those of a typical AI engineer, including supervising and mentoring AI engineers, overseeing the entire development cycle of TTS voice models, planning the annual research roadmap, exploring state-of-the-art AI-based TTS models, reporting research findings directly to C-level executives, and developing tools and engines for the inference process in production environments.

Additionally, I serve as an advisor to final-year students focusing on TTS and paralinguistic research. I have also been invited multiple times as a guest lecturer at Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) to teach Speech Synthesis systems using AI technologies.

## Responsibilities

- Led the Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Paralinguistic AI Research Team.
- Defined the annual research roadmap and set objective key results (OKRs).
- Led the full cycle of TTS voice model’s development, from audio and text data gathering, dataset pre-processing, model training, and model evaluation.
- Developed and maintained production ready AI inference engines for the TTS models.
- Led the development of internal libraries for the TTS-related inference process, supporting both production and development environments (e.g., Text Cleaner, Dataset Versioning Control, TTS Model Training Toolkits, etc.)
- Was invited as a guest lecturer in Bandung Institut of Technology (ITB) to teach speech synthesis.
- Supervised theses for several bachelor’s students on topics related to TTS or paralinguistics.
