## Introduction

A product roadmap is a strategic document that outlines the vision, direction, priorities, and progress of a product over time. It serves as a guide for the product development team, helping them understand what needs to be built, when it will be built, and the goals it is intended to achieve. Roadmaps also help communicate the product's vision to stakeholders like executives, sales teams, and customers.
