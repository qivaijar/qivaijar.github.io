## About

I began my career as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer in May 2020 at Prosa.ai, where I contributed to the development of high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice models, specifically tailored for Bahasa Indonesia. My responsibilities included data collection, dataset management, training toolkit exploration, TTS model training and evaluation, and continuous model improvement. I also developed libraries to support the inference process in production environments, such as text cleaners to normalize input text before feeding it into the model.

Additionally, I conducted research in paralinguistics, focusing on tasks such as emotion classification based on speech signals and COVID-19 diagnosis using cough recordings.
