## Introduction

[DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/) is an open-source tool designed for versioning machine learning models, datasets, and pipelines, much like Git does for code. DVC bridges the gap between machine learning and software development by providing version control for large datasets and models, ensuring reproducibility and collaboration in machine learning projects. Unlike Git, which is inefficient for handling large files, DVC stores data in external storage while keeping lightweight references in your Git repository.

## Applications of DVC

- **Data and Model Versioning**: DVC is used for versioning large datasets and machine learning models. This is particularly useful when working on long-term projects where datasets evolve over time, and you need to maintain different versions.
- **Collaborative Machine Learning Projects**: DVC enables teams to collaborate on machine learning projects without worrying about how to share massive datasets or models. It ensures that data consistency is maintained across multiple users.
- **Experiment Tracking and Management**: DVC helps manage and track experiments, allowing you to organize different configurations, datasets, and models. By storing metadata about each experiment, DVC enables easy comparison of results.
- **Pipeline Automation**: With its ability to manage ML pipelines, DVC can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, ensuring that any change in data or code triggers a rerun of the pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Data Versioning**: DVC allows you to version control large datasets, models, and other files that Git cannot handle efficiently. Each version of a dataset or model can be tracked, enabling easy rollback and comparison of different versions.
- **Storage Agnostic**: DVC integrates with a variety of storage backends, including cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud, Azure), network drives, and even local storage. It keeps a lightweight reference to your data in Git, while the actual data resides in external storage, making it more scalable.
- **Pipeline Management**: DVC supports building complex machine learning pipelines. It allows you to track the entire workflow, from data preparation to model training and evaluation, ensuring that any change in data, code, or configuration triggers a new pipeline execution.
- **Integrates with Git**: DVC seamlessly integrates with Git, allowing you to use familiar version control commands. The `dvc add`, `dvc commit`, and `dvc push` commands work similarly to Git commands, simplifying the learning curve.
