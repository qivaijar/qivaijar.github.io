I was promoted to Product Manager for Prosa TTS in January 2024. I oversee the product development process, starting from feature discovery based on feedback from stakeholders, task prioritization for each release version, and supervision of UI/UX design with product designers. I also manage feature development with backend and frontend engineers, testing in the staging environment with QA engineers followed by bug fixing, model deployment to production, testing in the production environment, and ongoing product and feature maintenance.

Additionally, I am responsible for designing the product roadmap, managing the backlog, creating product requirement documents, conducting product data analysis, and evaluating product performance.

<br/>

## Responsibilities

- Led the development team at **Prosa TTS**, an Indonesian SaaS-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) solution provider, serving over **320,000 users** with exclusive TTS voice models and advanced features.
- Conducted user and market research to drive product enhancements, resulting in an **NPS** increase to over **84 points**.
- Developed both short-term and long-term product roadmaps.
- Managed product backlogs based on insights from various stakeholders.
- Managed a cross-functional team of product UI/UX designers and software engineers, guiding them through the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to maintenance.
- Collaborated with the marketing team on announcing newly developed features and improvements, increasing the number of **new users** by **23%** over **8 Months**.
- Gathered data from various sources and analyzed product metrics to identify areas for improvement.
- Worked with the support team to address and resolve user complaints.
- Managed product-related documentation, such as product requirement documents (PRDs), user feedback, and periodic product reports.
`,a=`## About

I was promoted to Senior Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer in July 2021. My primary responsibility is leading the Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Paralinguistic Research team. This role extends my duties beyond those of a typical AI engineer, including supervising and mentoring AI engineers, overseeing the entire development cycle of TTS voice models, planning the annual research roadmap, exploring state-of-the-art AI-based TTS models, reporting research findings directly to C-level executives, and developing tools and engines for the inference process in production environments.

Additionally, I serve as an advisor to final-year students focusing on TTS and paralinguistic research. I have also been invited multiple times as a guest lecturer at Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) to teach Speech Synthesis systems using AI technologies.

<br/>

## Responsibilities

- Led the Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Paralinguistic AI Research Team.
- Defined the annual research roadmap and set objective key results (OKRs).
- Led the full cycle of TTS voice model’s development, from audio and text data gathering, dataset pre-processing, model training, and model evaluation.
- Developed and maintained production ready AI inference engines for the TTS models.
- Led the development of internal libraries for the TTS-related inference process, supporting both production and development environments (e.g., Text Cleaner, Dataset Versioning Control, TTS Model Training Toolkits, etc.)
- Was invited as a guest lecturer in Bandung Institut of Technology (ITB) to teach speech synthesis.
- Supervised theses for several bachelor’s students on topics related to TTS or paralinguistics.
`,i=`## About

I began my career as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer in May 2020 at Prosa.ai, where I contributed to the development of high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice models, specifically tailored for Bahasa Indonesia. My responsibilities included data collection, dataset management, training toolkit exploration, TTS model training and evaluation, and continuous model improvement. I also developed libraries to support the inference process in production environments, such as text cleaners to normalize input text before feeding it into the model.

Additionally, I conducted research in paralinguistics, focusing on tasks such as emotion classification based on speech signals and COVID-19 diagnosis using cough recordings.

<br/>

## Responsibilities

- Developed High-quality, exclusive AI-Based Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice models for Bahasa Indonesia.
- Explored various TTS model training toolkits to identify the best architecture for developing TTS voice models.
- Optimized TTS voice models for faster inference times and support for lower-end devices.
- Maintained internal libraries associated with the TTS inference process.
- Developed COVID-19 diagnosis system based on cough recordings.
- Developed emotion classification system based on speech signals.
`,s=`## About

I worked as a full-time researcher at the Networked System Laboratory (NSL) in Kumoh National Institute of Technology (KIT) from February 2018 to January 2020. While pursuing my master's degree, I focused on researching the integration of machine learning algorithms with wireless communication systems. I presented my findings at several international conferences and published more detailed versions in international journals.

<br/>

## Responsibilities

- Conducted research on integrating machine learning technology into wireless communication systems.
- Proposed novel ideas, designed systems, assessed performance, and documented findings in technical papers.
- Presented research results at domestic and international conferences and submitted a comprehensive version to international journals.
